* 1-2 graded assignments per week
* 2-3 checkpoint assignments per semeseter
* All assigned projects have a due date that is displayed on campus manager. Due dates are not string. You may turn in assignments at any time for some credit.
* Assignments are submitted by pushing code to you github repo, doing a pull request and then submitting the link to that pull request
* Make sure to add the link to the pull request of the homework.
* Some assignments have a point system so that you explicitly know how it will be graded, otherwise I will make github comments to tell you why you lost points.
* Do not copy other peoples code.
* Assignments will be given a full grade if completed. If turned in late, 10 points will be deducted.
* If anything, focus on the checkpoints as they are a majority of your grade.
