* 1-2 graded assignments per week
* 2-3 checkpoint assignments per semeseter
* All assigned projects have a due date that is displayed on campus manager.
* Assignments are submitted by pushing code to you github repo, doing a pull request and then submitting the link to that pull request
* Make sure to add the link to the pull request of the homework.
* Some assignments have a point system so that you explicitly know how it will be graded, otherwise I will make github comments to tell you why you lost points.
* Do not worry if the grade is not what you think it should be. Sometimes mistakes are made. Just bring it up to your instructor in person or on rocket chat.
* Do not copy other peoples code.
* Grading is not strict, you may turn it in at any point during the semester.
* If anything, focus on the checkpoints as they are a majority of your grade.
