### Description
I like to refer to this class as Applied Javascript, designed to take our Intermediate students to a level of fluency with Node.js and React.js that will allow them to build professional, well designed web applications. You can use these skills to become an entry level developer, a JavaScript developer a senior technical project manager, a full stack developer, or use your ability to learn new languages to switch into a career with Python, Ruby, or one of the many other in-demand languages in Texas.

This class is designed for someone who has a strong command of front end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and who is interested in formalizing their back end development skill set to become full stack.


### Prerequisites / Review
You should be completely comfortable with html and have a basic understanding on javascript. You don't need to be able to code a chess game in javascript but you should know what an if statement or for loop is.



### Methods of Instruction

We will be using a combination of materials such as slides, follow along demos, tutorials, 
reading assignments and homework projects
