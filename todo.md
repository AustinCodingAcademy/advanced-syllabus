### What we need to be doing with our lives
* Watch online lesson videos and if appropriate follow along doing what is demonstrated. Keep watching over and over and doing until you get it.
* Always be thinking about a project to work on. Final project
* Always be working on coding challenges on freecodecamp, hacker rank, Code Wars or anything else
* Read industry articles. Share any that helped you understand something or interest you.
* Learn how to organize yourself. Have a reference to all material we cover. You can't memorize stuff, you just need to know where to look for an example of how to do it. Googling everytime takes too long
* Not watching netflix or going on vacation.
